#####MySQL Environment Variables
These are automatically retrieved from the  MySQL Container if available.  If not you must set these manually

* ``MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_DATABASE``: The default database name is munkireport, if you have a different database name. Set it here as per your needs. (DEFAULT from MYSQL Container)
* ``MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_USER``: The default user to access the database with is admin. Change here as per your needs. (DEFAULT from MYSQL Container)
* ``MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_PASSWORD``: The default user password to access the database is admin. Change here as per your needs. (DEFAULT from MYSQL Container)
* ``MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR``: The FQDN or IP address of the database server. ie sql.test.internal (DEFAULT from MYSQL Container)

####Proxy Variable Settings

Munki Report is able to perform warranty lookups, however if your Munki Report server is behind a proxy this may fail.
To avoid this, we can provide proxy server information as variables when starting the container or providing defaults
in the Dockerfile when building the container.

There are two methods of setting the proxy server:

Mode 1
This sets just the proxy server address and port number

Mode 2
This sets the proxy server address, port number and a username and password to use if the proxy server is an authenticated proxy

* ``proxy_required``: Set this to mod1 or mod2 depending upon which type of proxy server config you need. If no proxy set to no
* ``proxy_server``: Set this to your proxy server address in the format proxy.example.com
* ``proxy_port``: Set this to your proxy server port number
* ``proxy_uname``: Set this to your proxy username if you need to use an authenticated proxy server
* ``proxy_pword``: Set this to your proxy password if you need to use an authenticated proxy server


# Munki Report Login

There is no default user, this setup requires LDAP.

If you require more advanced settings, modify the config.php as per your needs

# Running the container

This container requires a MYSQL container to be running first! I'm using the core MYSQL container but any container that sets the MYSQL variables listed above can work.  If it doesn't you can always specifiy them manually during startup of the Munkireport Container.

````bash
docker run --name mr-mysql \
  -v /usr/local/docker/mr-mysql:/var/lib/mysql \
  -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=ih4tjoih809ZYIOUHjk;h9 \
  -e MYSQL_DATABASE=munkireport \
  -e MYSQL_USER=munkireport \
  -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=IJSDFH_(*rhojkldfn9[8]) \
  -d mysql
````



```bash
docker run -d --name munkireport \
  -p 80:80 \
  --link mr-mysql:mysql \
  -e MR_SITENAME="My Company" \
  -e MR_MODULES="array('munkireport','diskinfo','timemachine')" \
  mholtrlc/munkireport
```

If you need proxy server support, either bake them into your Dockerfile, or provide them as environmentals when starting your container
by passing them with the -e flag, just like the variables shown above for the DB settings.
